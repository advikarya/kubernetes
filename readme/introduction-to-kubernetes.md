* The need for a Container Orchestration Engine
* Battles of COEs, which one to choose
* Key Features of a COE.
* What makes Kubernetes the defacto COE choice.
* Negatives of using Kubernetes

### `The need for a Container Orchestration Engine`
- What is Container Orchestration?
  Container orchestration is the automation of all aspects of coordinating and managing containers. Container orchestration is focused on managing the life cycle of containers and their dynamic environments.

- Why Do We Need Container Orchestration?
  Container orchestration is used to automate the following tasks at scale:
  
    --> Configuring and scheduling of containers
    --> Provisioning and deployments of containers
    --> Availability of containers
    --> The configuration of applications in terms of the containers that they run in
    --> Scaling of containers to equally balance application workloads across infrastructure
    --> Allocation of resources between containers
    --> Load balancing, traffic routing and service discovery of containers
    --> Health monitoring of containers
    --> Securing the interactions between containers.
